❈ What is Exploratory Data Analysis?

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of exploring, investigating and gathering insights from data using statistical measures and visualizations. The objective of EDA is to develop and understanding of data, by uncovering trends, relationships and patterns.

EDA is both a science and an art. On the one hand it requires the knowledge of statistics, visualization techniques and data analysis tools like Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn etc. On the other hand, it requires asking interesting questions to guide the investigation and interpreting numbers & figures to generate useful insights.

 Observations:

Here our mean is somewhere around 1961 and median is 1977.

Most of the companies are established between 1946-2007.

Our chart is showing left-skewed distribution.(A "skewed left" distribution is one in which the tail is on the left side.)

If the histogram is skewed left, the mean is less than the median.This is the case because skewed-left data have a few small values that drive the mean downward but do not affect where the exact middle of the data is (that is, the median).
